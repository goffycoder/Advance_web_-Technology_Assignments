Objective: Building models with Mongoose
Experiment 4: Create a database schema and model using mongoose and perform MongoDB queries for operations such as insert, update, and delete while also establishing a connection to the MongoDB database.
Hint: Ensure that your MongoDB server is running and accessible at localhost:27017 or replace it with the appropriate connection string if it's hosted elsewhere.
Note: Please include snapshots of all commands, terminal sessions, localhost outputs, and Mongo compass output in your documentation with all necessary steps
